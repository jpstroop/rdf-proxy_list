RDF Proxy List
==============

Implements a linked list with `ore:Proxy` nodes.


## Status

This gem is in early development. It implements ordered lists in the way
prescribed by the [Hydra Common Data Model](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/Hydra%3A%3AWorks+Shared+Modeling).
This work is the result of meetings in Nov. 2014 and Feb. 2015 at the White
Stag building in Portland, OR.
